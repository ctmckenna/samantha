Simple webapp (hello world)
===========================
In this tutorial we will build a simple 'hello world`
application. This tutorial covers the following:
* Using RIBS make system
* simple http server using an embedded ribs2

Step 1, setting up the environment.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* make sure you have the package 'build-essential' installed (On
  systems other than Ubuntu, make sure you have gcc and libc-dev
  installed).
* create top level directory for all your projects, we will be using
  'projects'.
* now change the current directory to 'projects'
* clone ribs2 (git clone https://github.com/Adaptv/ribs2.git)
* create the following directories: helloworld/ and helloworld/src

Step 2, make files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We need to build first ribs2 and then our projects. In order to do
that let's create top level Makefile that does exactly that.

Under the 'projects' directory, create new file called Makefile and
paste the following lines.
 ___________________________________________________________________
|                                                                   |
.                                                                   .
   all:
           @$(MAKE) -s -C ribs2          # make ribs2 first
           @echo "[helloworld] build"
           @$(MAKE) -s -C helloworld/src # make our project
   clean:
           @$(MAKE) -s -C ribs2 clean    # clean ribs2
           @echo "[helloworld] clean"
           @$(MAKE) -s -C helloworld/src clean  # clean our project
.                                                                   .
|___________________________________________________________________|

Now let's create Makefile for our project. Create and edit the file:
helloworld/src/Makefile and paste the following.
 ___________________________________________________________________
|                                                                   |
.                                                                   .
   TARGET=helloworld    # the name of the executable

   SRC=helloworld.c     # list of source files

   # we need to tell gcc where to find the include files of ribs2
   CFLAGS+= -I ../../ribs2/include
   # we need to tell the linker where to find ribs2 libraries
   LDFLAGS+= -L ../../ribs2/lib -lribs2

   include ../../ribs2/make/ribs.mk  # include ribs2 make system
.                                                                   .
|___________________________________________________________________|

In order for our project to compile we need to create
helloworld/src/helloworld.c with a simple main for now.
 ___________________________________________________________________
|                                                                   |
.                                                                   .
   int main(void) {
       return 0;
   }
.                                                                   .
|___________________________________________________________________|

This should be enough to test the make files. From 'projects'
directory, invoke the make command and check for errors. Also try
"make clean" to confirm it is working as well.


Step 3, let's write some code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's start by including "ribs.h". This include file includes the
entire ribs framework for you. No need to include more files.
 ___________________________________________________________________
|                                                                   |
.                                                                   .
   #include "ribs.h"
.                                                                   .
|___________________________________________________________________|

Now let's add a function that will be invoked when get a request
 ___________________________________________________________________
|                                                                   |
.                                                                   .
   static void my_server(void) {

   }
.                                                                   .
|___________________________________________________________________|

To initialize our server, we need to add the following to our main.
 ___________________________________________________________________
|                                                                   |
.                                                                   .
    /* must use the initializer or set all the values in
       http_server */
    struct http_server server = HTTP_SERVER_INITIALIZER;
    /* port number */
    server.port = 8080;
    /* call my_server upon receiving http request */
    server.user_func = my_server;
    /* init and check for errors */
    if (0 > http_server_init(&server)) {
        printf("http_server_init failed\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
.                                                                   .
|___________________________________________________________________|

Since our system is fully event driven we also need to initialize the
event loop. This can be done by adding the following lines.
 ___________________________________________________________________
|                                                                   |
.                                                                   .
    /* initialize the event loop */
    if (0 > epoll_worker_init()) {
        printf("epoll_worker_init failed\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
.                                                                   .
|___________________________________________________________________|

At this point our server is initialized but it won't accept
connections yet, we need to add the following to start accepting
connections (this split between init and accept is important when
using fork).
 ___________________________________________________________________
|                                                                   |
.                                                                   .
    /* tell http server to start accepting connections */
    if (0 > http_server_init_acceptor(&server)) {
        printf("http_server_init_acceptor failed\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
.                                                                   .
|___________________________________________________________________|

Everything is now initialized, we can now start our event dispatcher
by adding the following lines.
 ___________________________________________________________________
|                                                                   |
.                                                                   .
    /* lastly, we need to handle events */
    epoll_worker_loop();
.                                                                   .
|___________________________________________________________________|

Before we run it, let's add response. Add the following line to
my_server function.
 ___________________________________________________________________
|                                                                   |
.                                                                   .
    http_server_response_sprintf(HTTP_STATUS_200,
        HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE_TEXT_PLAIN, "hello world\n");
.                                                                   .
|___________________________________________________________________|

HTTP_STATUS_200 is used for successful request/response, other
responses are available as well, for example: HTTP_STATUS_404 which
means, page not found (see
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html for more
information).

HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE_TEXT_PLAIN specifies plain text response. You can
use additional types, for example:
 ___________________________________________________________________
|                                                                   |
.                                                                   .
   SSTRL(HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE_TEXT_XML, "text/xml");
.                                                                   .
|___________________________________________________________________|

You can now test the performance of your new server (throughput and
latency), we will be using apache benchmark which is part of
apache2-utils package.
 ___________________________________________________________________

.                                                                   .
   # first make sure your server is running
   $ ./helloworld/bin/helloworld &

   # run apache-benchmark
   $ ab -k -c 8 -n 1000000 http://localhost:8080/

   # -k for persistent connections, -c for concurrency of 8,
   # -n for 1 million requests
.                                                                   .
